    <h1>Welcome to my Homelab!</h1>
    <p><b>About Me:</b></p>
    <p>Infrastructure and DevOps Engineer. Curator of blinking LEDs and things in the cloud.</p>
    <p>My resume can be found <a href="https://dorwinia.com/resume.pdf">here.</a></p>
    <p><b>Projects</b></p>
    <p>All of my projects can be found on Github, specifically under the <a href="https://github.com/reschouw-homelab">reschouw-homelab</a> organization. As is often the case with a homelab, not all of the projects are actively running, but all of the code served it's purpose at one time or another. Some highlights are listed below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b><a href="https://github.com/reschouw-homelab/terraform-homelab">Terraform Repo:</a></b> This repo contains all of the Terraform configuration for my homelab. There are  a lot of different projects here, including a <a href="https://github.com/reschouw-homelab/terraform-homelab/tree/master/aws/modules/aws-instance">module</a> that configures instances via Ansible and adds some standardized AWS configurations.</li>
      <li><b><a href="https://github.com/reschouw-homelab/ansible-homelab">Ansible Repo:</a></b> This repo contains all of the Ansible configuration for my homelab. These playbooks are often used by the Terraform module to autoconfigure instances as they are spun up.</li>
      <li><b><a href="https://github.com/reschouw-homelab/user-config">Standardized Environment Config:</a></b> This is an attempt at automatically ensuring certain bits of my environment are standardized across different machines. Written to be portable across Linux and macOS</li>
      <li><b><a href="https://github.com/reschouw-homelab/game-of-life">Python and Go Experiments:</a></b> While I don't consider myself a programmer, programming was always fun. These projects were meant to refamiliarize my self with Python, learn some Go, and do some test-driven development.
