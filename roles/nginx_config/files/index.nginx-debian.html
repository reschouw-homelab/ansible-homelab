<p>Various additional services likely exist, but they aren't ones I want to advertise for obvious security reasons.</p>
<p>Services are not guaranteed to be up at any particular time. If you would like to request a service to be turned on, you know how to contact me. I am not made of money and don't want to pay excessive power bills because my servers are running 24/7. Yet.</p>
<p>Current projects:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/reschouw/HomelabHelper">Homelab Helper:</a> A slack bot that has WOL capabilities, can store device information for easy lookup, and can verify that hosts are up and running. Currently has a limited feature set, but I'm hoping to expand it over time.</p>
